# proton-mail-export-to-gmail
Tool for exporting ProtonMail mailbox to Gmail based on files generated by `Proton Mail Export Cli`

# Prerequisites

ProtonMail has released a tool called [`Proton Mail Export Tool`](https://proton.me/support/proton-mail-export-tool).

After launching it and authorizing access to your ProtonMail account, the tool will generate one `*.eml` file and one `*.json` file for each email message.

For example, if your mailbox contains **91,415 emails**, you will end up with **91,415 `*.eml` files** and **91,415 `*.json` files** on your disk.

You need a Gmail account (`gmail.com`) to which the `proton-mail-export-to-gmail` tool will export your email messages (based on the `*.eml` and `*.json` files).

# Solved issues
- Google Workspace has data transfer limits for Gmail. They are described at https://support.google.com/a/answer/1071518?hl=en in the article titled `Gmail bandwidth limits`.
- If you have a large number of emails in your ProtonMail account, the `Proton Mail Export CLI` tool can download, for example, 91,415 messages — which means you’ll end up with 91,415 `.eml` files and 91,415 `.json` files on your disk. The `proton-mail-export-to-gmail` application here solves this problem during migration.
